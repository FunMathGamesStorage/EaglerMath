# EaglercraftX-Client
Browser client for Eagler 1.8.8-u19. Server has to run locally on user's PC (or anywhere else). All credit for my eaglercraft projects goes to lax1dude for writing the eagler javascript runtime and the built in shader pack.

There will soon be major changes as I prepeare to upgrade and migrate all of my clients and servers to 1.8. There was never any singleplayer in lax1dude's original 1.8 clients, so single player support will probably never be added in.

Unfortunatly there is no localhost server at the time of writing, though updates are expected to come thick and fast. 

## Running (the following instructions apply only to my 1.5.2 clients and will be updated soon)
1) Download this: https://github.com/catfoolyou/Eagler-Online/tree/main/java
2) Run `run.bat` or `run_unix.sh` in both bungee and bukkit folders
3) Open the browser client
4) Connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:25565` to play on localhost

## No LAN? No problem.
If for some reason you are unable to connect between computers on your LAN network, or want to play outside of a LAN network.
