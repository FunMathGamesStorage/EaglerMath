# EaglercraftX-Client
Browser client for Eagler 1.8.8-u19. Server has to run locally on user's PC (or anywhere else). All credit for my eaglercraft projects goes to lax1dude for writing the eagler javascript runtime and the built in shader pack.

There will soon be major changes as I prepeare to upgrade and migrate all of my clients and servers to 1.8. There was never any singleplayer in lax1dude's original 1.8 clients, so single player support will probably never be added in.

Unfortunatly there is no localhost server at the time of writing, though updates are expected to come thick and fast. 

## Running
Current server replit: https://replit.com/@catfoolyougithu/eaglercraft-server

How to run:
1) Fork the repl
2) Go to the Cubernite folder and delete `world`, `world_nether` and `world_the_end` (this is mandatory)
3) Run the repl
4) Copy the adderesses from https://replit.com/@yourusername/eaglercraft-server?v=1 AND from https://eaglercraft-server.yourusername.repl.co/
5) In the client set up servers for both addresses
6) Join either server

### If it lags, use the offline HTML file instead of the browser client.

## No Replit? No problem.
If for some reason you are unable to connect to the Replit server, or it is blocked.
